# "Racial Disparity in Education, Poverty, and Single Parent Home Children" by Zara Clacken
This is an independent data science project examining racial disparity in single-parent homes, college degree completion, and poverty between the years 2013-2017.
In Python, I cleaned, filtered, and manipulated the data of 3 data frames found on the web, then exported my work as 3 csv files. I then used those
3 csv files to create a dashboard in Python. I have uploaded my process as 4 Jupyter lab notebooks.  
First, please read my code in the following notebooks to see my data manipulation process:
Children in Single Parent Homes by Race,
Degrees Completed by Race,
Poverty Population by Race.  
To see how I created a dashboard, please read
