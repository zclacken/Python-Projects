# Python Data Science Project by Zara Clacken
This is an independent data science project examining racial disparity in single-parent homes, college degree completion, and poverty.
In Python, I cleaned, filtered, and manipulated the data of 3 data frames found on the web, then exported my work as 3 csv files. I then used those
3 csv files to create a dashboard in Python. I have uploaded my process as 4 Jupyter lab notebooks.
